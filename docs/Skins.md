# Skins

Romp–Ø has multiple 'skins' that change the looks and layout of the interface.

* [Desktop](/RompR/Desktop-Skin) is the default skin on desktop devices. It is the one that most of the example images in these docs are taken from.
* [Phone](/RompR/Phone-Skin) is the default skin on small screens. It is optimised more for touchscreens.
* [Tablet](/RompR/Tablet-Skin) is an alternative skin designed for small screens bu that works more like the Desktop skin
* [Fruit](/RompR/Fruit-Skin) is an alternative skin intended for desktop devices, with a slightly different look intended to give more space to the Info panel.
* [Skypotato](/RompR/Skypotato-Skin) is my favourite skin, designed for medium-sized screens.

A default skin will be chosen the first time you open RompR but you can change it at any time from the Configuration menu.
