<h3 align="center">Version 1.41 Information</h3>
<ul>
<li>This version now supports Genres in the Music Collection. Your Collection will be updated automatically. (Note for Spotify users, Spotify does not seem to return Genres at all, even though the API documentation states that it does, so this functionality will be of limited use)</li>
</ul>
